        So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to
        McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's
        De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts
        for a type specimen book. It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum
        in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s,
        although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum
        passage in a book of old metal type samples. So far he hasn't relocated
        where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th.
